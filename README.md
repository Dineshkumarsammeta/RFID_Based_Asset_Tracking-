# RFID-Based Asset Tracking System

---

## 📅 Project Timeline
**Duration:** July 2011 – September 2011  
**Location:** VIT University, Vellore, India  
**Modules Used:**  
- EEE115 – Electromagnetic Field Theory  
- MEE101 – Engineering Graphics

## 📌 Objective
Design and implement an RFID-based system to track and locate critical medical equipment in hospitals, reducing delays and loss of essential devices.

---

## 🏥 Background & Relevance
In many Indian hospitals, nurses and technicians waste precious time searching for infusion pumps, wheelchairs, and ECG equipment. This delay affects patient treatment, especially in emergency situations.  
This project's objective was to create a reasonably priced RFID monitoring device for indoor medical environments.  

**NHS Relevance:** Hospitals in the UK face similar challenges in equipment management, making this project applicable to NHS facility operations.

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Attached **HF RFID tags** to selected devices.
2. Installed RFID readers at ward entrances and central corridors.
3. Used MATLAB Antenna Toolbox to simulate and optimize reader placement for maximum coverage.
4. Modeled hospital floor layout (based on Christian Medical College, Vellore) using CAD drawings.
5. Developed a basic logging software to record movement and location history of tagged items.
